### About

I'm a PhD student at the University of Sussex. My research interests include JIT compilation, functional programming, concurrency theory and type systems. At present my research aims to develop type systems and optimisation techniques for concurrent programming languages. My supervisor is [Dr Martin Berger](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/).

Outside of research, I'm interested in computing, photography, science, history, theology, games (board and video), vexillology, Rubik's cubes and many other things besides.
