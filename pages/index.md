### About

I'm a PhD student at the University of Sussex. My research interests include JIT compilation, functional programming, concurrency theory and type systems, especially session types. At present my research aims to develop type systems and optimisation techniques for concurrent programming languages. My supervisor is [Dr Martin Berger](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/).

Outside of research, I'm interested in computing, maths, photography, science, history, theology, games (board and video), vexillology, Rubik's cubes, fountain pens and many other things besides.
