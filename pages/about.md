# About

This is the personal website of Alex Jeffery. I blog here mostly about geeky codey stuff, but I have been known to get philosophical on occasion.

I'm interested in computing, photography, science, theology, games (board and video), vexillology, Rubik's cubes and many other things besides.

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Sussex. My research interests include JIT compilation, functional programming, concurrency theory and type systems. At present my research aims to develop just-in-time compilation techniques for concurrent programming languages. My supervisor is [Dr Martin Berger](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/).
