title: Flag Photos

I enjoy photography, and I really like taking pictures of flags. They're tricky
things to try and photograph, because they tend not to be at favourable angles
to frame nicely (they're usually high-up), and, of course, they flutter in the
wind, so even if you can line up a great shot, you still might not get a good
picture if the wind isn't strong enough or going in the right direction.

Here are some of my more share-worthy ones.

---

The flag of the Romanian revolution.

During the Romanian revolution in 1989, revolutionaries cut the coat-of-arms
of the Socialist Republic out of the flag, flying flags with holes to represent
a free Romania. Here a former revolutionary carries his flag during the
anti-corruption protests in 2017. This photo was taken in Piața Sfatului,
Brașov.
